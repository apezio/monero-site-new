### What We Collect

The Monero Project uses Google Analytics to collect usage and visitor data for this website. This is enabled via a small piece of JavaScript code, and will not run if you have JavaScript disabled.

We also collect standard server logs from our webserver. We do not collect cookies anywhere on the site except when using the Monero forum (located at [forum.getmonero.org](https://forum.getmonero.org)).

### What We Use the Data For

The Google Analytics data is used to provide statistics on the website and help us to improve the content and the information flow.

Server logs are used to analyse errors and diagnose requests to dead links. A portion of the server logs are used to gather statistics on Monero downloads in order to help us better understand our user's needs.

The cookies used on the Monero forum are used to identify returning users who have opted in to have their user session active for a period of time, as well as logged in users actively using the forum.
