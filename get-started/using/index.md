                        <p>Monero is a cryptocurrency that allows anonymous transactions around the world. Monero stands on pillars of security, privacy, and decentralization, and the community and developers are committed to protecting these values. We suggest learning more about how Monero works and reading the <a href="/get-started/what-is-monero/">What is Monero page</a>. The <a href="https://github.com/monero-project">source code for Monero</a> and all our official clients are available for public view and discussion on Github.</p>

                        <p>You need somewhere to store physical cash such as your bank, your wallet, or under your mattress. Although Monero is an entirely digital asset (you cannot touch them!), you still need a place to store them. This is done in a digital wallet. You oversee securing your own funds, and there is no way to restore them if you make a mistake. Thus, take great care in selecting the right wallet for you. Some are safer and others are more convenient than others. See our <a href="/downloads/">downloads page</a> for the wallets that The Monero Project has put out.</p>
