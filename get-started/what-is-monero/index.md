### Privacy

Monero seeks to provide users with the ability to conduct private and untraceable transactions in an effort to create true electronic cash. Transactions are private by default at the protocol level. However, users are able to selectively disclose information or even provide audit access (view only) to their full Monero account.


### Decentralization

Monero is based on an egalitarian proof of work model, which employs an algorithm that allows ordinary users to mine for new Monero with any modern CPU or GPU. As a result, the network hash power is more widely distributed and not centralized in large mining operations. Furthermore, Monero is not a company with a hierarchical structure beholden to shareholder interest. It is a Free and Open-Source Software (FOSS) project with mostly unpaid privacy-conscious volunteers with a passion for secure, high quality, publicly available code. Moneroâ€™s core branch has had over 9,600 commits made by 200+ contributors, representing more than 440,600 lines of code.


### Scaleability

Monero has a dynamic block size limit that is automatically recalculated regularly. A penalty system prevents out of control growth. Monero also implements a "permanent block reward." The block reward will never drop below 0.3 XMR, making Monero a disinflationary currency. The inflation will be roughly 1% in 2022 and go down gradually, but the nominal inflation will stay at 0.3 XMR per minute. This means that there will always be an incentive for miners to mine Monero.


### Fungibility

Using non-fungible tokens (coins that cannot be substituted in place of another) could eventually lead to blacklisting/whitelisting by governments or self-censorship. With Monero, this problem is avoided by having an opaque (non-transparent) blockchain where all tokens are equal. Unprivileged observers are incapable of ascertaining whether a certain token is spent or unspent in a transaction nor determine the origin, destination, or amount of transactions. Monero helps users keep their transaction information private from prying eyes.
